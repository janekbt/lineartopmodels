ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE 3 VARIABLES: 

1) "view" 
2) "bathrooms"
3) "sqm_living15"


***************************************************
1) VIEW
***************************************************

1.0) Plotting distributions

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
truehist(view, main = "View")
plot(x = view, y = price, main = "Price vs View")
qqView = qqPlot(view, main = "View")
boxplot(view, main = "view IQRx10", horizontal = TRUE, range = 10)
boxplot(view, main = "view IQR", horizontal = TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

1.1) Looking at the difference in average prices by view.

```{r}
dat_3 %>%
  select(price, view) %>%
  group_by(view) %>%
  summarise(mean(price))
```

1.2) Attemtp to change variable into a dummy of, has been viewed or not. Then also compute averges.

```{r}
# Creating wasViewed dummy
dat_3_1 = dat_3 %>%
  mutate(wasViewed = factor(ifelse(view > 0, 1, 0)))
  
# Looking at the average of viewed or not
dat_3_1 %>%
  select(price, wasViewed) %>%
  group_by(wasViewed) %>%
  summarise(mean(price))
```

1.3) Run models with each of the possibilities and comparing metrics.

```{r}

# Without neither 'view' or 'wasViewed'
lm1_1 = dat_3_1 %>% 
  select(-view, -wasViewed) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Without 'wasViewed' and leaving 'view' in
lm1_2 = dat_3_1 %>% 
  select(-wasViewed) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Without 'view' and leaving 'wasViewed' in
lm1_3 = dat_3_1 %>% 
  select(-view) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# With both of them 
lm1_4 = dat_3_1 %>% 
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

summary(lm1_1)
summary(lm1_2)
summary(lm1_3)
summary(lm1_4)

AIC(lm1_1, lm1_2, lm1_3, lm1_4)

BIC(lm1_1, lm1_2, lm1_3, lm1_4)
```

Results:

# Without neither 'view' or 'wasViewed'
Residual standard error: 0.225 on 21602 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8175,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8174 
F-statistic:  9677 on 10 and 21602 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
AIC: -3120.731
BIC: -3024.958

# Without 'wasViewed' and leaving 'view' in
Residual standard error: 0.2181 on 21601 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8285,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8284 
F-statistic:  9489 on 11 and 21601 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
AIC: -4466.259
BIC: -4362.505

# Without 'view' and leaving 'wasViewed' in
Residual standard error: 0.2185 on 21601 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.828,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8279 
F-statistic:  9450 on 11 and 21601 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
AIC: -4392.728
BIC: -4288.974

# With both of them 
Residual standard error: 0.218 on 21600 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8287,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8286 
F-statistic:  8710 on 12 and 21600 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
AIC: -4489.099
BIC: -4377.364


1.4) CONCLUSIONS:

Using both of the columns (the original view and the derivated wasViewed), yields lower RSS, higher Adj. R-squared, lower AIC and lowe BIC. For these reasons, we'll keep both of them in the model.




***************************************************
2) BATHROOMS
***************************************************

2.0) Plotting distributions
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
truehist(bathrooms, main = "bathrooms")
plot(x = bathrooms, y = price, main = "Price vs bathrooms")
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms, main = "bathrooms")
boxplot(bathrooms, main = "bathrooms IQRx5", horizontal = TRUE, range = 5)
boxplot(bathrooms, main = "bathrooms IQR", horizontal = TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

2.1) Checking the outliers count for IQRx3, IQRx5, IQRx10

```{r}

```





2.2) Plotting QQ-plots
```{r}
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms^(1/2), main = "bathrooms")
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms^(1/3), main = "bathrooms")
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms^(1/4), main = "bathrooms")
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms^(1/5), main = "bathrooms")
qqView = qqPlot(bathrooms^(2/3), main = "bathrooms")
```

2.3) Run models with each of the possibilities and comparing metrics.

**Keep using dat_3_1 with the newly added variable

```{r}
# Without this column
lm2_0 = dat_3_1 %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Without transforming
lm2_1 = dat_3_1 %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 1/2
lm2_2 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(1/2)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 1/3
lm2_3 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(1/3)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 1/4
lm2_4 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(1/4)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 1/5
lm2_5 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(1/5)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 2/3
lm2_6 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(2/3)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

# Transforming to the power of 2/5
lm2_7 = dat_3_1 %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms^(2/5)) %>%
  select(-bathrooms) %>%
  lm( data = . , price ~ .)

#summary(lm2_0)
#summary(lm2_1)
#summary(lm2_2)
#summary(lm2_3)
#summary(lm2_4)
#summary(lm2_5)
#summary(lm2_6)
#summary(lm2_7)


AIC(lm2_0, lm2_1, lm2_2, lm2_3, lm2_4, lm2_5, lm2_6, lm2_7)

BIC(lm2_0, lm2_1, lm2_2, lm2_3, lm2_4, lm2_5, lm2_6, lm2_7)
```
